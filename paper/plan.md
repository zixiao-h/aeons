# Background 
Physical connections - temperature

# The progress of a nested sampling
Introduce some of the required machinery 

Current temperature


# Method
Would like to extrapolate the L(X) curve to get the endpoint
- Many likelihoods are Gaussian
- BMD is the dimensionality of the samples if they *were* Gaussian
- So if we choose exactly a Gaussian likelihood profile with dimension BMD, we would expect to capture a likelihood with similar properties



Challenges:
- Phase changes in the parameters
- Divergent fits in the case that it is not Gaussian
