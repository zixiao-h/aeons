-------- TODO --------

Have we found the right maximum for P(X|logL)? 
Need a clever/visual way to show this. If we have, then can start thinking about missing terms in posterior

What is P(theta|X)?

Test on wedding cake likelihood




-------- DONE --------

Fix analytic Hessian, compare with torch Hessian - get same result.
Autograd much faster; even with cached analytic expressions, still have to sum over all terms
Plotted errorbars with using correct Hessian, 10 different instances

Cholesky normalised errors off-center due to regularising term

Calculate evidences for logX vs X. Doesn't seem to meet the eye test?

Basic implementation of P(X|logL)
Doesn't seem to work very well. Potential issues
- Is the maximum in the right place? Suspect not, might be missing a P(theta|X) term
- Have we found the right maximum? Clever way to see whether we have
